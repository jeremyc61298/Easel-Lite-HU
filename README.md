### A front end for RESTful-Api-HU
#### Strengths
  * To be honest, I don't feel like I have many in this project. If I had had more time to devote to this project, I think I could have done a more outstanding job. But as it is, I think the project is only up to par with what we've been learning. 

#### If I had more time...
  * I would clean up the code quite a bit. Because I didn't have much time for this project, I started to rush through it the longer I worked on it, and it shows. 
  * I would change the way I handled the ClassForm state. My intention was to create the ClassForm in a way that allowed for other parent components to use it however they wanted, but as I continued to work on it, it felt like it was the other way around. I think it goes to show that I need practice with the Container/Presenter pattern.
  * I would definitely add more style. Currently it looks terrible, and I would love to go back and use a CSS framework to clean up the UI.

#### All in all, I enjoyed the project, but I could have done better if I had given myself more time.
